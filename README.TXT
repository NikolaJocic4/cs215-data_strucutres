Some time ago in a small Greek village, the inhabitants decided that there was no escape from the Romans, 
which were a threat that was nearing them. The inhabitants settled on committing suicide, except one person, 
Kitsos. He instructed that the inhabitants should at least commit their suicide in a fashionable manner, 
so he suggested that they do them in an interval (Every second, third, etc..). 

This program aims to, through a carefully constructed algorithm, determine the best position, 
Kitsos should place himself at, so that he is the last man standing, meaning there will not be anybody 
to witness him not commit a suicide.
